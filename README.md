# SuperHack

### Short description
#### A max 280-character or less description of your project (it should fit in a tweet!)
Instant Q&A, live tech demos, and code generation trained on OP Stack documentation.

### Description
#### Go in as much detail as you can about what this project is. Please be as clear as possible!

When I first stumbled upon the OP Stack documentation, I was utterly overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin. I wanted to ask questions but I too embarassed to take up a sponsor's time, and sometimes I didn't even know what questions to ask. I was so close to just giving up on this hackathon when I realized: "Hey, maybe this is a problem I can help solve!" 

This is where I got the inspiration for Super.ai! The easiest way to get started with development on OP Stack.

Super.ai will be with you every step of the way to answer any questions you have, provide live Tech demos, and write code for you to reduce the friction when it comes to blockchain development!

### How it's made
#### Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details. What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together? If you used any sponsor technologies, how did it benefit your project? Did you do anything particuarly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning?
ChromaDB for creating vector embeddings
OpenAI for response generation
Next.JS for frontend
Metamask SDK for wallet authentication and adding of Optimism and Optimism Goerli chains
